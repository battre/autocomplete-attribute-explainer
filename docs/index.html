<h1>Extending the autocomplete attribute</h1>

<p>This is an effort to analyze the structures of address forms in a somewhat
machine readable way.

<p>This work is based on the following assumptions:
<ul>
  <li>The autocomplete spec was written with the intent to find a lowest common
    denominator that should work for all countries. An analysis of real-world
    web-forms indicates that those forms cannot be properly annotated with
    today's autocomplete attribute because it lacks expressiveness. Probably
    many site owners don't have a choice because shipping companies or local
    customs tell them how an address form should look like.
  <li>There are certain aspects that just apply to a few countries (e.g. Japan
    has phonetic names, Spain has paternal and maternal last names, Hungary
    splits the name of a street from the type of a street). The fact that these
    concepts only apply to a few countries does not make them go away. We should
    allow storing a few extra fields for Japanese, Spanish, Hungarian, ...
    addresses (i.e. decide which fields to offer based on the country of an
    address) because oftentimes customers and merchants are in the same
    country and share the same cultural norms when it comes to address forms.
  <li>I don't think that we can immediately fix autofill for all countries
    and this analysis does not cover all countries. I hope that this document
    leads to an architecture that can be extended.
  <li>We may need to combine certain atomic pieces of information into a single
    field (e.g. a house number and an apartment number). This process is
    probably very locale specific and needs to grow over time. The fact that
    we don't know how to combine two fields into one fillable string for
    some countries yet, hopefully does not invalidate the overall idea.
</ul>

<p>Note that this is work in progress. Feedback is highly appreciated.

<h2>Concepts</h2>

<p>
The following are concepts taken from the
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill">
  autocomplete specification
</a> with extensions that I deemed useful to make the autocomplete attribute
useful for more countries.

  <h2>Big and global questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do we want to support multiple field concurrent types? E.g. I see
    "name or company" fields. I don't see an obvious syntax for adding this
    capability to the autocomplee attribute. If you search for '[' below
    you can find examples where a website requested one (or more) of multiple
    field types.
  <li>How do we model the "everything else" field type? Do we want to call it
    "address-overflow", "address-supplement" (this seems to be a term that is
    quite common in many countries), "building-and-location-in-building" (also
    common)? The latter may be too narrow because it does not cover a company
    name or c/o. Some websites would not want a company or c/o in their
    "everything else" fileds while others would want them.<br>
    Instead of an "everything else" type we could ask websites to enumerate
    what should go into the list (see the previous bullet point).
  <li>Are we ok with introducing country specific concepts? E.g. Hungary
    separates the name of a street (e.g. "Amphitheatre") from the type of the
    street ("Ave", "Pkwy", "Blvd", ...). I haven't seen this anywhere else.
    It's essential to fill Hungarian address forms but we should not offer this
    to all users.
  <li>Do we allow forms to specify an encoding? E.g. Japanese forms are picky
    about ASCII, full-width or half-width characters.
  <li>TODO:
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic">patronymic name</a>
    is based on the first name of the father. As per
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Slavic_naming_customs">
    Eastern Slavic naming customs</a>, it is written in these countries in all
    legal and identity documents. Countries mentioned there include Russia,
    Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and to an extent in
    Kyrgyzstan, Georgia. But the list of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic">affected countries</a>
    is longer.
  <li>Many naming questions...
    <ul>
      <li>How do we call the location information to find
        a place inside a building? "location-in-building"? "sub-building"?
      <li>How do we name things that are very country/culture specific
        (Hungary's separation between street name and street type, entrecalles,
        ...)?
    </ul>
</ul>

  <p>Argentinian address forms rely on <b>street names</b>, <b>house numbers</b>,
  <b>floors</b> (Piso) and <b>apartments</b> (Departamento). Floors and
  apartments can be requested in a single input field or in two separate fields.

<p>On the street address level, we frequently see <b>between streets</b>, i.e.
  a field in which one specifies the names of two crossing streets to help
  locate the house number.

<p>The forms ask for states/provinces and localities/cities.

<p>Oftentimes the address form was filled via an address search box.

<p>Frequently a DNI was requested (national identification number).

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
  <li>street-name (calle)
  <li>house-number (número)
  <li>floor (piso)
  <li>apartment (departamento)
  <li>floor and/or apartment (piso y/o departamento)
  <li>"between streets" (entrecalles) - either with one input field or with
    two
  <li>additional information (datos adicionales/aclaración
    adicional/observations/Dirección Complementaria
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How do we deal with address-overflow? Oftentimes, this seems to ask for
    information within a building - floor and apartment - but theoretically it
    could be more flexible. Do we want to rely on "location-in-building"?
  <li>Do we want to support entrecalles (between streets) which are split across
    two fields? - Do we want to combine this with "landmark"?
  <li>Two forms asked for a "Lote" - a piece of land (a lot / parcel of land).
  <li>One form asked for a "Torre", which literally means a tower but in this context
    it would refer to a part of a building (e.g. front-building, a wing of a
    building, ...).
  <li>The concept of "partido" is not fully clear to me. One form asked for
    (provincia, partido, localidad), which I see as (province, part of a city,
    city). Another form asked for (partido, provincia) but no city. Maybe this was
    implied by the zip code?
</ul>

  <h3 id="BR"><a href="#BR">#</a> BR- Brazil 🇧🇷</h3>
  Brazil relies heavily on structured addresses. Basically every form
has separate fields for street name, house number and often an complement
(for apartments, blocks, ...). Oftentimes, a lot of information is
derived from the CEP (postal code).

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
  <li>street-name (endereço)
  <li>house-number (número)
  <li>additional information (Informações adicionais; Complemento (opcional)
    (Apartamento, sala, conjunto, edifício, andar, etc.); Complemento;
    Complemento e referência (Opcional); Complemento (Nº do apartamento,
    Bloco, etc.); Complemento (Apto/Bloco/Casa))<br> Informationen going
    into this are:
    <ul>
      <li>apartment, room, suite
      <li>building, block, house - often times people live in gated
        communities where the entire community has the same street name and
        house number. The Bloco identifies the building within the
        community.
      <li>floor
    </ul>
  <li>reference-point (landmark?) (Referência; Complemento e referência;
    Ponto de referência) - e.g. people would put 'same street as Church
    xyz' there to help the delivery person find the location.
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I have modeled the additional information as
    "building-and-location-in-building" and reference-point as "landmark".
    Any concerns about this? It will require some localization in the UI
    because Brasilians probably don't think of landmarks as reference-points.
</ul>

<p>Progress: ☑ First round of cleanup, ☑ Discussed with a (former) resident

  <p>The capital city of Brasilia is divided into sectors. The sectors appear as
  abbreviations in the address (three to four capital letters). A sector is
  divided into quadras, which are themselves divided into blocks (<a
    href="https://www.upu.int/UPU/media/upu/PostalEntitiesFiles/addressingUnit/braEn.pdf">source</a>).

<p>While most cities seem to follow a "street name, house number" schema, the
  capital Brasilia uses "sector, quadra, block, floor", e.g. SBN – Quadra 13 –
  Bloco B – 8º andar.
  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Nru1v31DUeKCwXvc7">Here</a> is an image of
  "Superquadra Sul (sector) 303 (quadra)", where each building is called
  a block. The address refers to block B and floor number 8.

<p>I looked up a zip code in Brasilia (70670-503) and a website
  (casasbahia.com.br) translated this into a two-line Endereço:
<pre>CLSW 101 Bloco Cn
Setor Sudoeste - Brasília - DF</pre>

<p>It is pretty common that the website only asks for the zip code (CEP),
  derives the Endereço, and then asks the user to enter Número (house number). For
  an address in Brasilia, I suppose that you would specify "s/n" as the number (as
  you don't have one - s/n = "sem número" = without number; some websites have a
  checkbox for this).

<p>For these reasons, I am not sure whether Bloco in a Complemento field
  refers to a block in Brasilia or needs to be supported as a separate
  field type.

  <h3 id="CA"><a href="#CA">#</a> CA- Canada 🇨🇦</h3>
  The sample of forms analyzed for Canada all shared the same structure.
While the sites mentioned examples of information to be put into
address lines 1 and 2 it looked like the fields were genuinely treated as
unstructured address lines 1 and 2.

  <h3 id="DE"><a href="#DE">#</a> DE- Germany 🇩🇪</h3>
  <p>German sites often ask for street name and house number in a single
designated filed or two separate fields. This is often complemented by an
address extension ("Addresszusatz"), a catch all field that can list an
apartment number (rare), c/o person or a company name.

<p>German address forms are special in that they often ask for gender,
saluation, and social / academic titles.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street-name (Straße)
<li>house-number (Hausnummer)
<li>address extension (Addresszusatz) - This can contain an apartment, company, c/o.
<li>salutation (Herr/Frau - Mr./Mrs.)
<li>academic title (Titel)
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Should we distinguish the salutation from an academic or noble title?
  <li>How do we model the address-supplement field?
</ul>

  <h3 id="ES"><a href="#ES">#</a> ES- Spain 🇪🇸</h3>
  Spanish addresses ask for street name and house number in either one or
two input fields. Spain is special because some websites ask for
ultra-detailed information (one field for each of):
<ul>
<li>Type of street
<li>Stair case
<li>Floor
<li>Apartment
<li>Gate ('Puerta' - might refer to an apartment)
<li>Residential area (?)
</ul>

This information can also be requested in a single address overflow
field.

<p>Progress: I need to speak to a resident first to better understand the
  details of Spanish addresses.

  <h3 id="FR"><a href="#FR">#</a> FR- France 🇫🇷</h3>
  French websites often work well with an address-line1 and 2. The
websites may specify what to put into each line but it looks like
address-line1 always gets the street name and house number.

<p>Some websites ask for a street name and house number and then also
have overflow fields.

<p>Many websites asked for a (binary) gender.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street name (Numéro)
<li>house number (Voie)
<li>building (Bâtiment)
<li>floor (Étage)
<li>stair case (Escalier) - just once in the sample
<li>door (Porte) - just once in the sample
<li>academic title (Titel)
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do we want to use lieu-dit for address-level3? Some cities have multiple
    sub-cities. A lieu-dit is the name of a subdivision of the city, usually
    very small (2-3 houses). Typically you would would put the lieu-dit into the
    street-address/address-lineX field because you don’t have street/house
    numbers in a lieu-dit.
  <li>Do we want to support door codes?
</ul>

  <h3 id="GB"><a href="#GB">#</a> GB- Great Britain 🇬🇧</h3>
  British houses have either numbers or names, or even both. As per <a
href="https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/guides/good-addressing-guidelines">this</a>,
a full address should contain a premise identifier, street details, post town
and the postcode. The premise identifier requires at least one of the 4 premise
elements: Company name, Building number, Building name, Sub building name.


<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street name
<li>house number
<li>house name
<li>town (separate field from a city - probably referring to a postal town).
Occurred once in the sample set.
<li>overflow field
</ul>
Street name + house number/name are often combined with another overflow
field.

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This requires some checking with a British resident. My proposals are too
    much guess work.
  <li>Do we want to distinguish between postal town and city?
</ul>

<a href="http://www.paulplowman.com/stuff/uk-address-oddities/">This</a> is an
entertaining article on the oddities of UK addresses.

  <p>Feedback from a Greek citizen:

<p>Νομός/ΝΟΜΟΣ is unambiguously the state (Νομό/ΝΟΜΟ in the accusative case).

<p>ΠΕΡΙΟΧΗ just means region and it is ambiguous. I would interpret it as any of
{suburb, city, state}, depending on what is missing in the form. It looks
correct in the examples you listed, but I wouldn't extrapolate from that.

<p>Επιπρόσθετες πληροφορίες: technically this is delivery-instructions (but the
particular example implies address-line2)

<p>Όνομα στο κουδούνι/όροφος: this is delivery-instructions like the next field,
but with a nudge about what the courier will need.

<p>Regarding missing concepts, father's first name is often requested. Autofill
incorrectly conflates this with middle names, which also exist.

  <h3 id="HR"><a href="#HR">#</a> HR- Croatia 🇭🇷</h3>
  Croatian address forms seem to be largely compatible with the autocomplete spec,
except that some forms asked for street name and house number in separate
fields. At last one form asked for an OIB (social security number).

<p>Progress: ☑ First round of cleanup, ☐ Discussed with a (former) resident

  <p>Hungary seems to have a mix of unstructured address forms and
ultra-detailed address forms, similar to some Hispanic/Latinx countries.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
  <li>name of public space (Közterület neve)
  <li>nature of public space (Közterület jellege)
  <li>street name (Utca Kötelezően) - the combination of the previous two field types
  <li>house number
  <li>building
  <li>floor
  <li>apartment
  <li>staircase
  <li>delivery-instructions
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How to name the particles of a street name.
</ul>

<p>Progress: ☑ First round of cleanup, ☑ Discussed with a (former) resident

  <p>Feedback from a native Hungarian:

<p>"Közterület jellege" is a "street type", such as {street, road,
drive, avenue, boulevard, square, etc.}. While in most languages the
street name emcompasses the name and the street type, in Hungarian they
are often separated in official records. "Közterület neve" could be
"Amphitheatre", "Közterület jellege" could be "Pkwy".

<p>"Épület" (Building): is only used when multiple buildings share the
same house number, so it identifies which one. Can be another number or
letter.

<p>"Lépcsőház" (Staircase): serves a similar purpose as "Épület"
(Building) when there are multiple entrances to a single building, and
there are mailboxes next to each.

<p>"Emelet" (Floor) / "Ajtó" (Door): These are a more structured way
to refer to an "apartment number", "flat number", or "room number"
in an office. These historically have the structure of "floor / door",
e.g. "3/1", meaning 3rd floor, 1st apartment within that floor. The
"door number" is most often a locally unique identifier within the
floor, not within the building as common in the US.

  <h3 id="ID"><a href="#ID">#</a> ID- Indonesia 🇮🇩</h3>
  <p>Indonesian addresses are special because of their depth, using all of
address-level1 through address-level4. Sometimes the higher address levels
(3 and 4) need to be entered into a textarea along with the street address
or into address-lineX fields. The address-levels are:
<ul>
<li>address-level1: Provinsi (Province)
<li>address-level2: Kota (City)
<li>address-level3: Kecamatan (District, part of a city or regency)
<li>address-level4: Kelurahan (Subdistrict, part of a district)
</ul>
Indonesian addresses often rely on &lt;select&gt; elements. The values
of one &lt;select&gt; element may only be populated after the user filled
the previous one. Sites also ship their own custom &lt;select&gt; elements.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
  <li>One form had an address line 4
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>n/a
</ul>

  <h3 id="IN"><a href="#IN">#</a> IN- India 🇮🇳</h3>
  <p>Indian addresses forms have surprising naming conventions. Forms
commonly ask for a 'House no/Apartment name'. The 'house number' is an
apartment number (not the sequence of a house in a street) and the
apartment name is the name of a building (most buildings have a name; this
is not referring to the name of an apartment).

<p>Another important aspect that is not common in other countries is a
'locality' (sometimes referred to as 'area details'). An example would be
'HITEC City' in Hyderabad. It's a name for an area that people know and use
for orientation. Another example would be 'old town'.

<p>A 'Colony' is a named group of buildings that belong to each other,
e.g. sharing amenities. Also serves as a landmark.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>landmark
<li>building (apartment name)
<li>apartment (house no)
<li>street name
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Should we support towers?
</ul>

<p>Progress: ☑ First round of cleanup, ☑ Discussed with a (former) resident
   - but India is large and there could be multiple different conventions.

  <h3 id="IT"><a href="#IT">#</a> IT- Italy 🇮🇹</h3>
  <p>Italian address forms often ask for a street name and house number in
separate fields.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street name
<li>house number
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Some forms seem to assume that address-line1 contains the street name and
  house number. Is that a valid assumption?
</ul>

  <h3 id="JP"><a href="#JP">#</a> JP- Japan 🇯🇵</h3>
  <p>Japanese address forms are special in that the
Postal Code is often spread across two input fields and users are often
asked to enter their name twice (once in phonetic spelling). Also Websites
often specify whether to use full-width or half-widths characters/numbers.

<p>Within a city, buildings are often identified by a sequence of 3 numbers
[chome / city district]-[city block]-[building number] a forth number
can be appended for the apartment number, but often times there is a special
field for the building name and apartment number. See
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">Wikipedia</a>

<p>A certain complexity arises from the chome/city district (丁目), which
is sometimes grouped in the format 1-2-3 and sometimes apears together with
a city (<a href="#2-httpswww.dinos.co.jp">example</a>).
I haven't understood whether the chome is just represented by the number
or also comes with a name.

<p>The municipality is often expressed with the following terms (spaces
added by me for the western eye that cannot parse kanji characters):
<ul>
<li>市 区 町 村:<br>
 (市 = shi = large city)<br>
 (区 = ku = ward (sub division of a large city))<br>
 (町 = chō or machi (town))<br>
 (村 = mura or son (village))
<li>市 区 町 村 名:<br>
 as first + 名 ???
<li>市 区 町 村 番地:<br>
 as first + (番地 = banchi (lot number used in some rural and older city areas)
<li>市区郡　町村名／丁目:<br>
 (市 = shi = large city)<br>
 (区 = ku = ward (sub division of a large city))<br>
 (郡 = gun (district; in Japan, a city is separate from districts, which contain towns and villages))<br>
 (町 = chō or machi (town))<br>
 (村 = mura or son (village))<br>
 (名 = ???)<br>
 (丁目 = chōme (city district))<br>
</ul>

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>phonetic family and given name
<li>street-location (chorme, city block, house number)
<li>building-and-location-in-building (building name and apartment number)
<li>postal-codes are often spread across two fields
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>...

  Placeholder attributes often show the symbol 〇, meaning 'to correct/confirm'. I
also found that ✖, 〇 and △ mean false, correct, and somewhere in the middle.
This might be a way to express the preferred format.

  <h3 id="MX"><a href="#MX">#</a> MX- Mexico 🇲🇽</h3>
  <p>Every address form asks for a
<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_(Mexico)\">colonia</a>,
which is a neighborhood in a Mexican city (which has no jurisdictional
autonomy or representation) or a gated community. It is interesting that
some cities have a municipality, but not all. This <b>probably</b> means
that we treat a colonia as an address-level4 to have a fixed assignment.
If there is no address-level3 fields, we probaby want to combine it with
the city field (address-level2). Alternatively, we would need to be able
to split a city into the city and delegacion. This is one of the cases
where I don't know how ot read the autocomplete spec.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street-name
<li>external number (house number)
<li>internal number (apartment number)
<li>entre calles (between streets) or landmark
<li>Colonia and sometimes Delegación o Municipio (Delegation or Municipality)
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How to deal with address-level3 or address-level4 for colonia (see above)
</ul>

  <p>Malaysian addresses forms are very simple, typically with address
lines 1, 2 and sometimes "additional address information". TBH most
websites tested looked like international websites and those that looked
more local could not be tested because they required a local phone number.
For this reason only few websites are listed here. All others looked the
same.

<h4>Open questions</h4>

  <h3 id="NG"><a href="#NG">#</a> NG- Nigeria 🇳🇬</h3>
  <p>Practically all websites I have seen relied on unstructured addresses.
I observed that most websites I saw were hosted via WooCommerce which may
be a common practice or a sampling bias. I saw a single exceptional website
which asked for the LGA (Local Government Area). As per official
guidelines, addresses have the following order of elements (see page 28 of
<a href="https://www.nipost.gov.ng/Site_Downloads/NIGERIAN-NATIONAL-ADDRESSING-STANDARD-AND-GUIDELINES.pdf">here</a>):
District, Postcode, City, Local Government Area, State,
Country. This means that a city would need to be address-level3. In
practice my sample of sites did not ask for LGAs frequently (except for one
page) so there would be a high chance of confusion if we supported this
field as address-level2.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>delivery-instructions
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How to deal with LGA (see above)?
</ul>

  <h3 id="RU"><a href="#RU">#</a> RU- Russia 🇷🇺</h3>
  Russian addresses are super confusing:

<p><a href="https://spbtranslations.com/articles/how-do-i-address-a-letter-to-russia">This source</a>
points out that address data can be transliterated and translated. It contains
some common terms.

The following quote helps understanding the structures. ("n.b." are by myself, I
am not 100% sure these are correct)
<blockquote>
  "The Russian address system might get a bit confusing, as each address is
  often made up of a bunch of information, an inheritance of the Soviet mass
  construction of tall multi-apartment buildings. So, you’ll usually have a
  “dom” [n.b.: дом] number, which refers to the whole complex; then, since many
  housing complexes in Russia are massive and contain multiple buildings, most
  of which are accessible from an inner courtyard, you’ll also have a “korpus”
  [n.b.: корп.] number referring to the specific building; the “stroenie” [n.b.:
  стр.] number is quite similar to the “korpus”, as it still refers to the
  specific building of a complex having a common entrance from the main street;
  then, you may have a “pod’ezd” [n.b.: Подъезд], aka the actual entrance to an
  apartment located in a multi-storey building; and finally, the “kvartira”
  [n.b.: Квартира], referring to the specific apartment accessible from the
  specific “pod’ezd”, inside the specific “stroenie” or “korpus” of a certain
  “dom”." - https://thetranssiberians.com/2015/08/30/hostels-in-russia/
</blockquote>

A Russian colleague clarified this as follows:
<blockquote>
  Stroenie is a building inside a building set that are not accessible from a
  street. Good example - buildings on a factory territory. Korpus is a building
  inside a building set with its own entrance from a street. Usually you can
  have one of them. The interesting thing begins when a territory is divided
  into several. In that case a building may receive “korpus”. Example: Moscow,
  Ulitsa Rogova, 12 korpus 2 stroenie 1. Many government documents have just one
  field “korpus/stroenie”. Then you will fill in with “k.2 s.1”.
  <p>If a website does not have fields for korpus/stroenie, this information
    would go into the "dom"/"дома" field.
</blockquote>

Finally, <a
href="https://www.upu.int/UPU/media/upu/documents/PostCode/Thorougfare-Types-and-Abbreviations.pdf">this</a>
is handy because it contains a number of abbreviation and translations.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>address-search - Many websites have an interactive address widget into which
  you fill city, street and house information
<li>street-name
<li>house-number
<li>stroenie
<li>korpus
<li>entrance
<li>floor
<li>apartment
<li>door-code
<li>delivery-instructions
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do we want a field type for the "ouside-address" to be filled into address search fields?
  <li>Do we want to have different types for handling the situation that a "dom"
    field needs to represent the "korpus"/"stroenie” as well because there are
    no separate fields for those?
</ul>

  <h3 id="TR"><a href="#TR">#</a> TR- Turkey 🇹🇷</h3>
  <p>Turkish addresses are special because the concept translated to
a city (Şehir/Il) is more comparable to states in other countries. We have
the following granularities:
<ul>
<li>Şehir/Il: City (note: this is more comparable to states in other countries) - address-level1
<li>İlçe: District (note: this is more comparable to cities in other countries) - address-level2
<li>Mahalle/Köy: Neighborhood/Village (a neighborhood in the country side) - address-level3
</ul>

<p>The majority of addresses seem to be unstructured addresses (I haven't copied them all).

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li> TODO after getting this the annotations checked
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I have low confidence in some of the translations.
</ul>

<p>Progress: ☑ First round of cleanup, ☐ Discussed with a (former) resident
