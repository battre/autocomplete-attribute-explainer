overview: |
  Addresses in Poland follow the structure described in the following <a href="https://www.upu.int/UPU/media/upu/PostalEntitiesFiles/addressingUnit/polEn.pdf" > DOCUMENT</a>.
  Street Addresses in Poland typically consist of street name, building number and apartment number. 
  Specifically for data model of Poland the node <b>building-and-unit</b> was created to store house number and apartment number in one node. 
  The whole node of street-address for Poland in redundant, since the data is stored in <b>building-location</b> node, but we keep the main <b>street-address</b> node to preserve generic i18n project tree like data structure.
