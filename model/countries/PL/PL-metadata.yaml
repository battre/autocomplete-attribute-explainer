overview: |

 Street Addresses in Poland typically consist of street name, building number and apartment number. 
 Specifically for data model of Poland the node <b>building-and-unit</b> was created to store house number and apartment number in one node. 
 The whole node of street-address for Poland in redundant, since the data is stored in <b>building-location</b> node, but we keep the main <b>street-address</b> node to preserve generic i18n project tree like data structure.
