  <p>India has a lot of variety in address forms compared to many other
  countries. We observe a lot of variance in how websites label the fields
  of their address forms. By and large we observe three concepts besides
  city, state and postal code which together make up the address lines 1, 2, 3:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Building and flat number</b> (sometimes labeled "House/Flat no.", "Flat
  number / Building Name", "Apartment / House No."): Because Indian addresses
  often don't contain a street name and because the term "Apartment" is
  typically used to refer to the name of a building (not to a flat number), we
  suggest to model this as "street-location". It is the information that
  identifies a building.
  <li><b>Locality</b> (sometimes labeled "locality", "area", "Street / Society",
  "Street/Colony/Area Name", "Locality/Sector/Area"): This is a named area of a
  city that contains the building and ideally contains no two buildings with the
  same name. We suggest using the "locality2" concept for this as it's a
  subsection of a city and therefore comparable to neighborhoods in other
  countries.
  <li><b>Landmark</b>: This is a reference to a well known building or location that
  helps finding the building or locality (e.g. "near Birla Mandir temple").
  </ul>
  <p>These concepts occur on websites in various combinations:
  <ul>
  <li>As a single-line street address
  <li>As unstructured address lines 1, 2, 3
  <li>As 3 atomic fields: Building and flat number, Locality, Landmark
  <li>As 1 combined and 1 atomic field:
  <ul>
  <li>Building and flat number + Locality, Landmark (most common among the 3)
  <li>Building and flat number, Locality + Landmark
  <li>Building and flat number + Landmark, Locality (least common)
  </ul>
  (note that the statement "most common among the 3" is not based on an
  exhaustive survey among all websites but on a somewhat small sample).
  </ul>
  <p>We observed that roughly half of websites rely on a single street address
  or address lines 1, 2, 3. The remainder relies on structured information.
  <p>Based on the observed popularities we suggest to merge the 3 atomic fields
  and "Building and flat number + Locality, Landmark" in the primary address
  hierarchy. The other two combinations are represented as synthesized-nodes,
  meaning that they are not stored in the model but derived from the leaf nodes.
