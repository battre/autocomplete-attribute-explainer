  <p>India has a lot of variety in address forms compared to many other
  countries. In particular the flat number, building name, street, landmark
  and "area / locality" (modeled as locality2) seem to appear in every
  in almost arbitrary combinations (e.g. flat number as a separate field, or
  grouped with building name, or grouped with building name and street, ...).
  <p>The structures below are structures we have least confidence in so far.
