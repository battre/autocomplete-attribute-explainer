overview: |

 Street Addresses in Netherland typically consist of street name, building number and in-building location (toevoeging). 
 For data model of Netherland subset of Polish data model was used. The node <b>building-and-unit</b> was reused to store house number and in-building location in one node. 
 As in Polish model, whole node of street-address is redundant, since the data is stored in <b>building-location</b> node, but we keep the main <b>street-address</b> node to preserve generic i18n project tree like data structure.
