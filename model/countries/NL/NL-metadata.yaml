overview: |

 <p>Netherlands address forms rarely use the address line concept.
 Instead, they use more granular fields describing entities like city, postal code, state, street name, and building number.
 This addressing system is unified across the country, except for a few cities and districts.
 Address fields in the Netherlands can be divided into two groups: high-level location and street address.</p>
 <p><b>High-level location</b></p>
 <p>High-level location fields are: country, state, city, and postal code.
 The postal code in the Netherlands provides a precise location, often down to the street name, meaning two different streets will generally have different postal codes.
 Due to this precision, some forms omit high-level data like city name or even street name.</p>
 <p><b>Street address location</b></p>
 <p>Street address fields are: street name, building number, and unit. The street name and building number identify a specific building,
 while the unit ('toevoeging') specifies the location within that building.
 The unit can be an apartment number (e.g., 'A', 'II', '3') or a more complex code (e.g., 'A-02') that includes
 information about the floor or part of the building. </p>
 <p>There are two common patterns for street addresses:
 <ul>
 <li> Three atomic fields: street name + building number + unit
 <li> One combined field and one atomic field: street name with building number + unit. 
 </ul></p>
 <p>For the Netherlands' street address, a custom 'building-location' node was used with two child nodes: 'street' (containing the street name) and 'building-and-unit' (grouping 'building' and 'unit' nodes, as these are often requested in a single field).</p>
