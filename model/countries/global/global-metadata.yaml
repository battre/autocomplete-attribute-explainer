  <p>The following tree of concepts serves as a baseline whichs gets adapted
  for individual countries.
  <p>For example <code>family-name-first</code> is a concept that is prevalent
  in Spain and Mexico but not in the United states. It is a subconcept of
  <code>family-name</code>. So users in Spain and Mexico could have a first
  family name stored, but when they interact with Canadian websites, only the
  aggregated <code>family-name</code> would be filled. Most Canadian website
  developers and users probably have no idea what a first family name
  represents and should not be bothered with the concept.
