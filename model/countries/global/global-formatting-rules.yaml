# By default, tokens are separated by space.
# A separator is bound to the following field:
# Assume a, b, c are fields and s1 and s2 are separators, then "a s1 b s2 c"
# leads to "{a}{s1}{b}{s2}{c}" if all fields are non-empty, but if "b" is
# empty, it leads to "{a}{s2}{c}".
# A field prefix or field suffixs to the following/preceding field.
# "{a}{prefix}{b}{suffix}{c}" evaluates to "{a}{c}" if "b" is empty.
