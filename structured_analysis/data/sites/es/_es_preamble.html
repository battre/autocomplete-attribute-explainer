Spanish addresses ask for street name and house number in either one or
two input fields. Spain is special because some websites ask for
ultra-detailed information (one field for each of):
<ul>
<li>Type of street
<li>Stair case
<li>Floor
<li>Apartment
<li>Gate ('Puerta' - might refer to an apartment)
<li>Residential area (?)
</ul>

This information can also be requested in a single address overflow
field.

<p>Progress: I need to speak to a resident first to better understand the
  details of Spanish addresses.
