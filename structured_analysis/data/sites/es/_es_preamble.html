Spanish addresses ask for street name and house number in either one or
two input fields. Spain is special because some websites ask for
ultra-detailed information (one field for each of):
<ul>
<li>Type of street
<li>Stair case
<li>Floor
<li>Apartment (either 'letra' or 'puerta' which was once described as the
delivery door but also refers to an apartment)
<li>Urbanización
</ul>

This information can also be requested in a single address overflow
field.

<p>First discussions with a Portuguese person indicated the following:
<ul>
  <li><s>Gate/Puerta/Porta (PT)/Door (EN) is the building/house number. Usually is next
    to the door, that's why it is called just door.</s>
    -- Note to self: There are some websites that seem to contradict this. I
    will try to find more country experts.
  </li>

    The definition of letra was not quite clear. I have confirmed from multiple
    sources that this refers to apartment numbers. E.g <a
    href="https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/letra-bloque-portal-escalera.1768794/">here</a>:
    "Letra, Doors in apartment blocks in spain sometimes have a letter rather
    than a number........Bloque : Block .......... Portal, Door Escalera Some
    big blocks have more than one entrance so each Stairs are given a letter
    too". Also an the HTML name-attribute associated letra with apartment.

    Floor/Stair case and Apartment. Apartments are usually numbered. It is not
    like in Germany where you have your last name next to the doorbell. Each
    apartment has a number. That number is composed by first the floor number
    and then the number/side of the apartment on that floor. For example:
    apartment "34" is the 4th apartment on the 3rd floor. Or apartment "3rd
    left" is the apartment on the 3rd floor on the left side. Some websites have
    separate fields for the floor number and apartment. So in the example prior
    would be: Floor: 3; Apartment: 4 or Left. Sometimes they just say Apartment
    number, you would just put 34 or 3rd left.

    Urbanización is a small area of houses or buildings in a city. They may
    be gated communities but don't have to be gated communities. They are
    much smaller than a parish and just point to a general small area in a city.
    An Urbanización is not official and usually doesn't need to filled in an
    address form. It often shares amenities (playground, swimming pool, garage)
    among the residents and the construction of multiple houses belonging
    to the Urbanización was led by the same company. I am still looking for an apropriate translation.
    <a href="https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/Urbanizaci%C3%B3n">This</a>
    suggests "(private) housing development". <a
    href="https://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=Urbanizaci%C3%B3n">This</a>
    also suggests "residential area".

    Streets sometimes are long and have no numbers, indicated by "s/n" put in
    the number field (sin numero). Instead of the number, buildings are then
    referenced either by building name ("Edificio [name]") or sometimes groups
    of buildings/gated communities are called Urbanización which also have a
    name. Within the Urbanización, apartment buildings are then referenced by
    staircase ("Escalera/Esc. [number]").

    Tipo de vía (type of street) is often a &lt;select&gt; element with
    many options. Different websites don't agree on a standard set. Maybe we
    should just offer a limited set ("Calle", "Plaza", "Avenida" were mentioned
    to me as the most popular ones) and "other". If the stored record is
    "other", we don't fill. Or we fill the last observed value in case it is
    found on the current website.<br>
    If we fill a form which has a sparatent entry for "Tipo de vía" and we
    select "Calle", we should not repeat that in the street name field. "Avenida
    San Martín" becomes "Avenida" (type of street) and "San Martín" (name of
    street).<br>
    <a href="https://www.laputa.it/spanish-street-types/?lang=en">This</a> is
    an interesting articule on Spanish street types. It states that the street
    type is a prefix of the specific piece of a street name.
