<p>The capital city of Brasilia is divided into sectors. The sectors appear as
  abbreviations in the address (three to four capital letters). A sector is
  divided into quadras, which are themselves divided into blocks (<a
    href="https://www.upu.int/UPU/media/upu/PostalEntitiesFiles/addressingUnit/braEn.pdf">source</a>).

<p>While most cities seem to follow a "street name, house number" schema, the
  capital Brasilia uses "sector, quadra, block, floor", e.g. SBN – Quadra 13 –
  Bloco B – 8º andar.
  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Nru1v31DUeKCwXvc7">Here</a> is an image of
  "Superquadra Sul (sector) 303 (quadra)", where each building is called
  a block. The address refers to block B and floor number 8.

<p>I looked up a zip code in Brasilia (70670-503) and a website
  (casasbahia.com.br) translated this into a two-line Endereço:
<pre>CLSW 101 Bloco Cn
Setor Sudoeste - Brasília - DF</pre>

<p>It is pretty common that the website only asks for the zip code (CEP),
  derives the Endereço, and then asks the user to enter Número (house number). For
  an address in Brasilia, I suppose that you would specify "s/n" as the number (as
  you don't have one - s/n = "sem número" = without number; some websites have a
  checkbox for this).

<p>For these reasons, I am not sure whether Bloco in a Complemento field
  refers to a block in Brasilia or needs to be supported as a separate
  field type.
