Brazil relies heavily on structured addresses. Basically every form
has separate fields for street name, house number and often an complement
(for apartments, blocks, ...). Oftentimes, a lot of information is
derived from the CEP (postal code).

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
  <li>street-name (endereço)
  <li>house-number (número)
  <li>additional information (Informações adicionais; Complemento (opcional)
    (Apartamento, sala, conjunto, edifício, andar, etc.); Complemento;
    Complemento e referência (Opcional); Complemento (Nº do apartamento,
    Bloco, etc.); Complemento (Apto/Bloco/Casa))<br> Informationen going
    into this are:
    <ul>
      <li>apartment, room, suite
      <li>building, block, house - often times people live in gated
        communities where the entire community has the same street name and
        house number. The Bloco identifies the building within the
        community.
      <li>floor
    </ul>
  <li>reference-point (landmark?) (Referência; Complemento e referência;
    Ponto de referência) - e.g. people would put 'same street as Church
    xyz' there to help the delivery person find the location.
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I have modeled the additional information as
    "building-and-location-in-building" and reference-point as "landmark".
    Any concerns about this? It will require some localization in the UI
    because Brasilians probably don't think of landmarks as reference-points.
</ul>
