<p>Japanese address forms are special in that the
Postal Code is often spread across two input fields and users are often
asked to enter their name twice (once in phonetic spelling). Also Websites
often specify whether to use full-width or half-widths characters/numbers.

<p>Within a city, buildings are often identified by a sequence of 3 numbers
[chome / city district]-[city block]-[building number] a forth number
can be appended for the apartment number, but often times there is a special
field for the building name and apartment number. See
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">Wikipedia</a>

<p>A certain complexity arises from the chome/city district (丁目), which
is sometimes grouped in the format 1-2-3 and sometimes apears together with
a city (<a href="#2-httpswww.dinos.co.jp">example</a>).
I haven't understood whether the chome is just represented by the number
or also comes with a name.

<p>The municipality is often expressed with the following terms (spaces
added by me for the western eye that cannot parse kanji characters):
<ul>
<li>市 区 町 村:<br>
 (市 = shi = large city)<br>
 (区 = ku = ward (sub division of a large city))<br>
 (町 = chō or machi (town))<br>
 (村 = mura or son (village))
<li>市 区 町 村 名:<br>
 as first + 名 ???
<li>市 区 町 村 番地:<br>
 as first + (番地 = banchi (lot number used in some rural and older city areas)
<li>市区郡　町村名／丁目:<br>
 (市 = shi = large city)<br>
 (区 = ku = ward (sub division of a large city))<br>
 (郡 = gun (district; in Japan, a city is separate from districts, which contain towns and villages))<br>
 (町 = chō or machi (town))<br>
 (村 = mura or son (village))<br>
 (名 = ???)<br>
 (丁目 = chōme (city district))<br>
</ul>
