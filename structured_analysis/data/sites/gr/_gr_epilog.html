<p>Feedback from a Greek citizen:

<p>Νομός/ΝΟΜΟΣ is unambiguously the state (Νομό/ΝΟΜΟ in the accusative case).

<p>ΠΕΡΙΟΧΗ just means region and it is ambiguous. I would interpret it as any of
{suburb, city, state}, depending on what is missing in the form. It looks
correct in the examples you listed, but I wouldn't extrapolate from that.

<p>Επιπρόσθετες πληροφορίες: technically this is delivery-instructions (but the
particular example implies address-line2)

<p>Όνομα στο κουδούνι/όροφος: this is delivery-instructions like the next field,
but with a nudge about what the courier will need.

<p>Regarding missing concepts, father's first name is often requested. Autofill
incorrectly conflates this with middle names, which also exist.
