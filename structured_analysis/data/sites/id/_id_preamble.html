<p>Indonesian addresses are special because of their depth, using all of
address-level1 through address-level4. Sometimes the higher address levels
(3 and 4) need to be entered into a textarea along with the street address
or into address-lineX fields. The address-levels are:
<ul>
<li>address-level1: Provinsi (Province)
<li>address-level2: Kota (City)
<li>address-level3: Kecamatan (District, part of a city or regency)
<li>address-level4: Kelurahan (Subdistrict, part of a district)
</ul>
Indonesian addresses often rely on &lt;select&gt; elements. The values
of one &lt;select&gt; element may only be populated after the user filled
the previous one. Sites also ship their own custom &lt;select&gt; elements.
