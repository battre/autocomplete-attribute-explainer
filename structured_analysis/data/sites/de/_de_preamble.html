<p>German sites often ask for street name and house number in a single
designated filed or two separate fields. This is often complemented by an
address extension ("Addresszusatz"), a catch all field that can list an
apartment number (rare), c/o person or a company name.

<p>German address forms are special in that they often ask for gender,
saluation, and social / academic titles.
