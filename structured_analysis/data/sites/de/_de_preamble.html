<p>German sites often ask for street name and house number in a single
designated filed or two separate fields. This is often complemented by an
address extension ("Addresszusatz"), a catch all field that can list an
apartment number (rare), c/o person or a company name.

<p>German address forms are special in that they often ask for gender,
saluation, and social / academic titles.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street-name (Straße)
<li>house-number (Hausnummer)
<li>address extension (Addresszusatz) - This can contain an apartment, company, c/o.
<li>salutation (Herr/Frau - Mr./Mrs.)
<li>academic title (Titel)
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Should we distinguish the salutation from an academic or noble title?
  <li>How do we model the address-supplement field?
</ul>
