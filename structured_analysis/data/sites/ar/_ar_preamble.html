<div>Argentinian address forms rely on <b>street names</b>, <b>house numbers</b>,
  <b>floors</b> (Piso) and <b>apartments</b> (Departamento). Floors and
  apartments can be requested in a single input field or in two separate fields.
</div>

<div>On the street address level, we frequently see <b>between streets</b>, i.e.
  a field in which one specifies the names of two crossing streets to help
  locate the house number.</div>

<div>The forms ask for states/provinces and localities/cities.</div>

<div>Oftentimes the address form was filled via an address search box.</div>

<div>Frequently a DNI was requested (national identification number).</div>

<h4>Missing field type</h4>
<div>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
  occurred on multiple sites:
  <ul>
    <li>street-name (calle)
    <li>house-number (número)
    <li>floor (piso)
    <li>apartment (departamento)
    <li>floor and/or apartment (piso y/o departamento)
    <li>"between streets" (entrecalles) - either with one input field or with
      two
    <li>additional information (datos adicionales/aclaración
      adicional/observations/Dirección Complementaria
  </ul>
</div>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How do we deal with address-overflow? Oftentimes, this seems to ask for
    information within a building - floor and apartment - but theoretically it
    could be more flexible. It's unclear to me whether we want to add a joined
    type for floor and apartment and whether we want to skip address-overflow
    for Argentina in this case. For Australia I defined a "part-of-building" for
    "level, apartment and unit".
  </li>
  <li>Do we want to support entrecalles (between streets) which are split across
    two fields? - Do we want to combine this with "landmark"?</li>
  <li>Two forms asked for a "Lote" - a piece of land (a lot / parcel of land).
  </li>
  <li>One form asked for a "Torre", which literally means a tower but in this context
    it would refer to a part of a building (e.g. front-building, a wing of a
    building, ...). </li>
  <li>The concept of "partido" is not fully clear to me. One form asked for
    (provincia, partido, localidad), which I see as (province, part of a city,
    city). Another form asked for (partido, provincia) but no city. Maybe this was
    implied by the zip code?
  </li>
