<p>Argentinian address forms rely on <b>street names</b>, <b>house numbers</b>,
  <b>floors</b> (Piso) and <b>apartments</b> (Departamento). Floors and
  apartments can be requested in a single input field or in two separate fields.

<p>On the street address level, we frequently see <b>between streets</b>, i.e.
  a field in which one specifies the names of two crossing streets to help
  locate the house number.

<p>The forms ask for states/provinces and localities/cities.

<p>Oftentimes the address form was filled via an address search box.

<p>Frequently a DNI was requested (national identification number).

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
  <li>street-name (calle)
  <li>house-number (número)
  <li>floor (piso)
  <li>apartment (departamento)
  <li>floor and/or apartment (piso y/o departamento)
  <li>"between streets" (entrecalles) - either with one input field or with
    two
  <li>additional information (datos adicionales/aclaración
    adicional/observations/Dirección Complementaria
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How do we deal with address-overflow? Oftentimes, this seems to ask for
    information within a building - floor and apartment - but theoretically it
    could be more flexible. Do we want to rely on "location-in-building"?
  <li>Do we want to support entrecalles (between streets) which are split across
    two fields? - Do we want to combine this with "landmark"?
  <li>Two forms asked for a "Lote" - a piece of land (a lot / parcel of land).
  <li>One form asked for a "Torre", which literally means a tower but in this context
    it would refer to a part of a building (e.g. front-building, a wing of a
    building, ...).
  <li>The concept of "partido" is not fully clear to me. One form asked for
    (provincia, partido, localidad), which I see as (province, part of a city,
    city). Another form asked for (partido, provincia) but no city. Maybe this was
    implied by the zip code?
</ul>
