<div>Australia has largely simple addresses with
  <ul>
    <li>address lines 1, 2, 3, or
    <li>street name, house number and up to one field for extra information
      (apartment number, floor, etc.).
  </ul>
</div>

<h4>Missing field type</h4>
<div>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
  occurred on multiple sites:
  <ul>
    <li>street-name
    <li>house-number (also referred to as street no)
    <li>location-in-building / building-and-location-in-building (Lvl, Apt or Unit No.;
      Building/Floor/Apartment/Unit; Suite, building, level, etc. (optional)
  </ul>
</div>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How do we unify "location-in-building" and "floor and/or apartment" found in
    Argentina? The two are probably the same, but the former is more intuitive in
    AU (it's sometimes paired with a building name) while the latter is more
    intuitive in AR.
  </li>
</ul>
