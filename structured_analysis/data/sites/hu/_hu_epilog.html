<p>Feedback from a native Hungarian:

<p>"Közterület jellege" is a "street type", such as {street, road,
drive, avenue, boulevard, square, etc.}. While in most languages the
street name emcompasses the name and the street type, in Hungarian they
are often separated in official records. "Közterület neve" could be
"Amphitheatre", "Közterület jellege" could be "Pkwy".

<p>"Épület" (Building): is only used when multiple buildings share the
same house number, so it identifies which one. Can be another number or
letter.

<p>"Lépcsőház" (Staircase): serves a similar purpose as "Épület"
(Building) when there are multiple entrances to a single building, and
there are mailboxes next to each.

<p>"Emelet" (Floor) / "Ajtó" (Door): These are a more structured way
to refer to an "apartment number", "flat number", or "room number"
in an office. These historically have the structure of "floor / door",
e.g. "3/1", meaning 3rd floor, 1st apartment within that floor. The
"door number" is most often a locally unique identifier within the
floor, not within the building as common in the US.
