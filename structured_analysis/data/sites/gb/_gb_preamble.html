British houses have either numbers or names, or even both. As per <a
href="https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/guides/good-addressing-guidelines">this</a>,
a full address should contain a premise identifier, street details, post town
and the postcode. The premise identifier requires at least one of the 4 premise
elements: Company name, Building number, Building name, Sub building name.


<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street name
<li>house number
<li>house name
<li>town (separate field from a city - probably referring to a postal town).
Occurred once in the sample set.
</ul>
Street name + house number/name are often combined with another overflow
field.

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This requires some checking with a British resident. My proposals are too
    much guess work.
</ul>

<p>Progress: ☑ First round of cleanup, ☐ Discussed with a (former) resident
