<p>Practically all websites I have seen relied on unstructured addresses.
I observed that most websites I saw were hosted via WooCommerce which may
be a common practice or a sampling bias. I saw a single exceptional website
which asked for the LGA (Local Government Area). As per official
guidelines, addresses have the following order of elements (see page 28 of
<a href="https://www.nipost.gov.ng/Site_Downloads/NIGERIAN-NATIONAL-ADDRESSING-STANDARD-AND-GUIDELINES.pdf">here</a>):
District, Postcode, City, Local Government Area, State,
Country. This means that a city would need to be address-level3. In
practice my sample of sites did not ask for LGAs frequently (except for one
page) so there would be a high chance of confusion if we supported this
field as address-level2.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>delivery-instructions
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How to deal with LGA (see above)?
</ul>
