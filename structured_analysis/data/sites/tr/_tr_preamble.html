<p>Turkish addresses are special because the concept translated to
a city (Şehir/Il) is more comparable to states in other countries. We have
the following granularities:
<ul>
<li>Şehir/Il: Province (City) - many people refer to these as "city" and we see
  "city" in the source code a lot. This is because often provinces share the name
  of the big city. (note: this is more comparable to states in other countries) -
  address-level1
<li>İlçe: County/District (note: this is more comparable to cities in other countries) - address-level2
<li>Mahalle/Köy: Neighborhood/Village (a neighborhood in the country side) - address-level3
</ul>

<p>The majority of addresses seem to be unstructured addresses (I haven't copied them all).

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li> street-name
<li> building (every building has a house number, some also have a name)
<li> house-number
<li> apartment
<li> delivery instructions
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>n/a
</ul>

Note that a Turkish citizen shared that people often copy the
Mahalle/Köy in the street-address field even if there is a separate field for
that. Also in rural areas people put their phone number in the free-text field
so that the delivery service can call them because the street-name and
house-number are not sufficient to find houses in the country side.
