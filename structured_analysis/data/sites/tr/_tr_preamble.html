<p>Turkish addresses are special because the concept translated to
a city (Şehir/Il) is more comparable to states in other countries. We have
the following granularities:
<ul>
<li>Şehir/Il: City (note: this is more comparable to states in other countries) - address-level1
<li>İlçe: District (note: this is more comparable to cities in other countries) - address-level2
<li>Mahalle/Köy: Neighborhood/Village (a neighborhood in the country side) - address-level3
</ul>

<p>The majority of addresses seem to be unstructured addresses (I haven't copied them all).

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li> TODO after getting this the annotations checked
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I have low confidence in some of the translations.
</ul>
