French websites often work well with an address-line1 and 2. The
websites may specify what to put into each line but it looks like
address-line1 always gets the street name and house number.

<p>Some websites ask for a street name and house number and then also
have overflow fields.

<p>Many websites asked for a (binary) gender.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street name (Numéro)
<li>house number (Voie)
<li>building (Bâtiment)
<li>floor (Étage)
<li>stair case (Escalier) - just once in the sample
<li>door (Porte) - just once in the sample
<li>academic title (Titel)
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do we want to use lieu-dit for address-level3? Some cities have multiple
    sub-cities. A lieu-dit is the name of a subdivision of the city, usually
    very small (2-3 houses). Typically you would would put the lieu-dit into the
    street-address/address-lineX field because you don’t have street/house
    numbers in a lieu-dit.
  <li>Do we want to support door codes?
</ul>
