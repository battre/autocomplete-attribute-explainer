<p><b>Warning:</b> The following is very preliminary and it is unclear whether
it is correct because it contradicts common usage patterns we have today.

<p>
Mexican addresses are structured as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Estado (State, 32 states + federal district) - address-level1
  <li>Municipio (Municipality - some have one city, others may have more cities;
      a few are even divided into Delegaciónes) - address-level2
  <li>Ciudad (City) - address-level3
  <li>Colonia (Neighborhood, but not to be confused with Barrio, which is
    smaller but not common in MX address forms) - address-level4
</ol>

<p>
An exception is the federal district of Mexico City, which should be modeled as
<ol>
  <li>Estado (Mexico City) - address-level1
  <li>Delegación - address-level2
  <li>Mexico City is not divided into cities but e.g. <a
  href="https://docs.informatica.com/data-as-a-service/address-verification/h2l/0918-address-verification-best-practices-for-mexico-addresses/mexico-addresses/address-format-and-address-structure.html">this</a>
  suggests to put CIUDAD DE MÉXICO as the city and CDMEX as the state.

  selects Ciudad de México as the city and Distrito Federal as the state. Given
  that the field is often mandatory, it makes sense to assume that Mexico City
  is also a Ciudad. - address-level3
  <li>Colonia (Neighborhood) - address-level4
</ol>

<p>
The Municipio is typically not required in a shipping address, but the
Delegación in Mexico City is mandatory. If a form does not have a field for
Delegación, a resident of Mexico City would put the Delegación into the Ciudad
field.

<p>Every address form asks for a
<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_(Mexico)\">colonia</a>,
which is a neighborhood in a Mexican city (which has no jurisdictional
autonomy or representation) or a gated community.

<p>Addresses can refer to a Lote and a Manzana. A Manzana is a block in a
neighborhood, typically square and surrounded by streets. A Lote is a plot of
land within a Manzana. A Lote can consist of one or multiple buildings which can
have different house numbers (sometimes distinguished by suffix like 10-A, 10-B
but also by different numbers). A Manzana can be part of a Supermanzana. E.g.
"Calle 54 No. 111, Lote 2 Manzana 3 SM 66" would be building 111 in street 54,
which is located in Lote 2, which is part of Manzana 3, which is part of
Supermanzana 66.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street-name
<li>external number (house number)
<li>internal number (apartment number)
<li>entre calles (between streets) or landmark
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Warning:</b> It's an unsolved challenge that Mexico has the concept of
  Delegación or Municipio because that puts Ciudad (city) to address-level3, while
  websites use address-level2 for cities.<br>
  If we assign a Ciudad to address-level3, we break many existing websites. If
  we assign a Ciudad to address-level2 and introduce a new concept for
  Delegación or Municipio, we render the definition of the address-levels ad
  absurdum.
</ul>
