<p>Every address form asks for a
<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_(Mexico)\">colonia</a>,
which is a neighborhood in a Mexican city (which has no jurisdictional
autonomy or representation) or a gated community. It is interesting that
some cities have a municipality, but not all. This <b>probably</b> means
that we treat a colonia as an address-level4 to have a fixed assignment.
If there is no address-level3 fields, we probaby want to combine it with
the city field (address-level2). Alternatively, we would need to be able
to split a city into the city and delegacion. This is one of the cases
where I don't know how ot read the autocomplete spec.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>street-name
<li>external number (house number)
<li>internal number (apartment number)
<li>entre calles (between streets) or landmark
<li>Colonia and sometimes Delegación o Municipio (Delegation or Municipality)
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How to deal with address-level3 or address-level4 for colonia (see above)
</ul>
