<p>Indian addresses forms have some surprising naming conventions:

<p>Forms commonly ask for a 'House no/Apartment name'. The 'house number' is an
apartment number (not the sequence of a house in a street) and the apartment
name is the name of a building (most buildings have a name; this is not
referring to the name of an apartment). Alternative labels for this field 'Flat
no, Building' or 'Building name and flat number'. In most cases the house number
and apartment name had to be filled into a common field, in rare cases they
went into separate fields.

<p>Websites sometimes ask for a colony 'Colony', which is a named group of
buildings that belong to each other, e.g. sharing amenities. This is not very
common. We saw two cases where the website asked to enter the colony in the
'building and flat number' field and one cases where the website aked to enter
the colony in the 'street' field.

<p>Next websites typically ask for a street ("Street name or number", "Street
address"). As house numbers (in the sense of an seqential number assigned to
buildings in a street) are not very common, often times this only requires the
name of a street.

<p>Indian websites also ask for a 'locality' (sometimes referred to as 'area
details'). An example would be 'HITEC City' in Hyderabad. It's a name for an
area that people know and use for orientation. Another example would be 'old
town'.

<p>Also landmarks are common.

<p>In total we have 4 different field types (building and apartment, street,
locality, landmark) that succeed a recipient name and precede city/state/postal
code. There is no common standard on how to fill these 4 field types into forms.
Different websites group information differently. Here is a survey of 33
websites (rows with the same shade go into a single input field):

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Number of websites</th>
    <th>6</th>
    <th>10</th>
    <th>8</th>
    <th>5</th>
    <th>2</th>
    <th>2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Building + Apartment</td>
    <td> </td>
    <td rowspan="3"> </td>
    <td rowspan="4"> </td>
    <td> </td>
    <td rowspan="2"></td>
    <td rowspan="2"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Street-location</td>
    <td rowspan="2" bgcolor="lightgrey"> </td>
    <td rowspan="3" bgcolor="lightgrey"> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Locality</td>
    <td rowspan="2" bgcolor="lightgrey"></td>
    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Landmark</td>
    <td bgcolor="grey"> </td>
    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"> </td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  </table>

<p>Read this as 6 websites had a field for the "Building and Apartment",
another field for "Street-location and Locality", and a third for "Landmark".
In the last column, "Building and Apartment", "Street" and "Landmark" are
combined in a single field.

<h4>Missing field types</h4>
<p>The following cases are currently missing in the autocomplete spec and
occurred on multiple sites:
<ul>
<li>landmark
<li>building (apartment name) (typically entered together with the apartment
number in a single field)
<li>apartment number (house no/flat no)
<li>street name
</ul>

<h4>Open questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Should we support towers? Only one website in the sample set asked for it.
</ul>

<p>Progress: ☑ First round of cleanup, ☑ Discussed with a (former) resident
   - but India is large and there could be multiple different conventions.
