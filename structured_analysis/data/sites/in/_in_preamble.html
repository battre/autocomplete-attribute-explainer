<p>Indian addresses forms have surprising naming conventions. Forms
commonly ask for a 'House no/Apartment name'. The 'house number' is an
apartment number (not the sequence of a house in a street) and the
apartment name is the name of a building (most buildings have a name; this
is not referring to the name of an apartment).

<p>Another important aspect that is not common in other countries is a
'locality' (sometimes referred to as 'area details'). An example would be
'HITEC City' in Hyderabad. It's a name for an area that people know and use
for orientation. Another example would be 'old town'.

<p>A 'Colony' is a named group of buildings that belong to each other,
e.g. sharing amenities. Also serves as a landmark.

<h4>Open questions</h4>

<p>Progress: ☑ First round of cleanup, ☑ Discussed with a (former) resident
   - but India is large and there could be multiple different conventions.
