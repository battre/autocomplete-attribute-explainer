Russian addresses are super confusing:

<p><a href="https://spbtranslations.com/articles/how-do-i-address-a-letter-to-russia">This source</a>
points out that address data can be transliterated and translated. It contains
some common terms.

The following quote helps understanding the structures. ("n.b." are by myself, I
am not 100% sure these are correct)
<blockquote>
  "The Russian address system might get a bit confusing, as each address is
  often made up of a bunch of information, an inheritance of the Soviet mass
  construction of tall multi-apartment buildings. So, you’ll usually have a
  “dom” [n.b.: дом] number, which refers to the whole complex; then, since many
  housing complexes in Russia are massive and contain multiple buildings, most
  of which are accessible from an inner courtyard, you’ll also have a “korpus”
  [n.b.: корп.] number referring to the specific building; the “stroenie” [n.b.:
  стр.] number is quite similar to the “korpus”, as it still refers to the
  specific building of a complex having a common entrance from the main street;
  then, you may have a “pod’ezd” [n.b.: Подъезд], aka the actual entrance to an
  apartment located in a multi-storey building; and finally, the “kvartira”
  [n.b.: Квартира], referring to the specific apartment accessible from the
  specific “pod’ezd”, inside the specific “stroenie” or “korpus” of a certain
  “dom”." - https://thetranssiberians.com/2015/08/30/hostels-in-russia/
</blockquote>

A Russian colleague clarified this as follows:
<blockquote>
  Stroenie is a building inside a building set that are not accessible from a
  street. Good example - buildings on a factory territory. Korpus is a building
  inside a building set with its own entrance from a street. Usually you can
  have one of them. The interesting thing begins when a territory is divided
  into several. In that case a building may receive “korpus”. Example: Moscow,
  Ulitsa Rogova, 12 korpus 2 stroenie 1. Many government documents have just one
  field “korpus/stroenie”. Then you will fill in with “k.2 s.1”.

Finally, <a

is handy because it contains a number of abbreviation and translations.
