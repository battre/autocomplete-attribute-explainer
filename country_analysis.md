# Analysis of a number of countries

**Written**: 2022-09-04, **Updated**: 2022-09-12

The purpose of this document is to analyze common address patterns of real-world
websites and provide guidancen on how to annotate the fields.

The data of this sheet was generated by analyzing the top 50 e-commerce websites
as per https://ecommercedb.com/, though frankly most countries are only
reflected by the alphabetically first sites until I got the subjective feeling
of not learning anything new.

I use the following representation of addresses below:
* A | B: this is a sequence of two input elements (e.g. "street name | house
  number" = the first field gets the street name, the second the house number).
* A/B: this is a single input element where the website listed A and B and
  aspects that should be filled (e.g. "Lvl/Apt/Unit" = you should fill the floor
  numer, apartment number and unit number in this field).
* A `newline` B: The same concept is presented on one website as A and on another
  as B.

The recommened annotations assume field types that are spelled out in section
[Missing field types](#missing-field-types) below.

The focus is on fields that provide a more structured representation of a
`street-address` field. Names and phone numbers will require more work.

## Argentina (AR)

Argentinian address forms rely on street names and house numbers. Every form
asks for "Piso" and departamento", sometimes in a single field sometimes in
two fields. The forms ask for states/provinces and localities/cities. One form
asked for "Partido" *and* Localidad. I don't understand this.

Frequently a DNI was requested (national identification number).

Australia has largely simple addresses with
* address lines 1, 2, 3, or
* street name, house number and up to one field for extra information (apartment
  number, floor, etc.).

## Brazil (BR)

Brazil is special because the street name (enderço) is derived from the zip code
(CEP) and typically not editable by the user. The user needs to provide the
house number (Número). The capital, Brasilia, is different because it's split
into sectors and quadrants (which go into the enderço). The buildings don't have
house numbers but are referred to as blocks (bloco), which are also encoded in
the zip code. In this case, the houses have no house numbers (indicated by
"s/n", either in a text field or via a checkbox).

An address extension (complemento) plays an important role - a catch all field
for further information, including an apartment number.

TODO: Try to understand better how the bloco and casa are used in Brasilian
addresses.

The capital city of Brasilia is divided into sectors. The sectors appear as
abbreviations in the address (three to four capital letters). A sector is
divided into quadras, which are themselves divided into blocks.
([source](https://www.upu.int/UPU/media/upu/PostalEntitiesFiles/addressingUnit/braEn.pdf))

While most cities seem to follow a "street name, number" schema, the capital
Brasilia uses "sector, quadra, block, floor", e.g. SBN – Quadra 13 – Bloco B –
8º andar. [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/Nru1v31DUeKCwXvc7) is an image of
"Superquadra Sul (sector) 303 (quadra)", where each building is called a block.
The address refers to block B and floor number 8.

I looked up a zip code in Brasilia (70670-503) and a website (casasbahia.com.br)
translated this into a two-line Endereço:
```
CLSW 101 Bloco C
Setor Sudoeste - Brasília - DF
```
It is pretty common that the website only asks for the zip code (CEP), derives
the Endereço, and then asks the user to enter Número (house number). For an
address in Brasilia, I suppose that you would specify "s/n" as the number (as
you don't have one - s/n = "sem número" = without number; some websites have
a checkbox for this).

For these reasons, I am not sure whether Bloco in a Complemento field refers to
a block in Brasilia or needs to be supported as a separate field type.

## Canada (CA)

Skipped, similar to US

## Croatia (HR)

Croatian address forms seem to be largely compatible with the autocomplete spec,
except that some forms asked for street name and house number in separate fields.
At last one form asked for an OIB (social security number).

I checked several other sites but they were just repetitions of whatś shown above.

## Denmark (DK)

Danish address forms are very simple, typically asking for a single street-address field, a postal code and a city.

## Germany (DE)

Germany asks for street name and house number in a single or two different
fields. This is often complemented by an address extension ("Addresszusatz"), a
catch all field that can list an apartment number (rare), c/o person or a
company name.

German address forms are special in that they often ask for gender, saluation,
and social / academic titles.

## Indonesia (ID)

Indonesian addresses are special because of their depth, using all of
address-level1 through address-level4. Sometimes the higher address levels (3

"Közterület jellege" is "street type", such as {street, road, drive, avenue,
boulevard, square, etc.} While in most languages street name emcompasses the
name and the street type, in Hungarian they are often separated in official
records. "Közterület neve" could be "Amphitheatre", "Közterület jellege" could
be "Pkwy".

"Épület" (Building): is only used when multiple buildings share the same house
number, so it identifies which one. Can be another number or letter.

"Lépcsőház" (Staircase): serves a similar purpose as "Épület" (Building) when
there are multiple entrances to a single building, and there are mailboxes next
to each.

"Emelet" (Floor) / "Ajtó" (Door): These are a more structured way to refer to an
"apartment number", "flat number", or "room number" in an office. These
historically have the structure of "floor / door", e.g. "3/1", meaning 3rd
floor, 1st apartment within that floor. The "door number" is most often a
locally unique identifier within the floor, not within the building as common in
the US.

## India (IN)

India had so many snow flake forms that I present the fields of a street address
in sequence (stripping the Pincode which was always present). Often times sites
have a single text input field (not textarea) for a street address, a textarea,
or multiple address lines. These often seem to capture a building location that
gets complemented by an apartment number, building name, etc. to help routing
further.

Some naming conventions are surprising, forms commonly ask for "House
no/Apartment name". The "house number" in this is an apartment number (not the
sequence number of a house in a street) and the apartment name is the name of a
building (most buildings have a name, not really the name of an apartment).

Another important aspect that is not common in other countries is a "locality"
(sometimes referred to as "area details"). An example would be "HITEC City" in
"Hyderabad". It's a name for an area that people know and use for orientation.
Another example would be "old town".

A "Colony" is a named group of buildings that belong to each other, e.g. sharing
amenities. Also serves as a landmark.

Indian address forms often ask for a landmark and additional information (free
text).

<b id="f-in-1">[in-1]:</b> While it looks very counter intuitive, all of this is
correct. The "House Number" is an apartment number within a building. 801 would
be room 1 on the 8th floor. The "Apartment name" refers to the name of the
building. The "street details" would be the street name and house number (where
available). Area detals are also calles localities. Basically some named
districts like "old town" or "high tech center" - names that help people
navigate large cities. [↩](#in-1)

## Japan (JP)

Japanese address forms are special in that the Postal Code is typically spread
across two input fields and users are often asked to enter their name twice
(once in phonetic spelling). Also Websites often specify whether to use
full-width or half-widths characters/numbers.

We often see an address field which has 2 or 3 numbers in the placeholder attribute
as per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system) these numbers indicate [block]-[building]-[apartment number].

We often see that building names are important and can be combined with a
street-location or stand alone.

While the address system is super complex, the HTML forms look pretty regular
to the untrained eye.

## Malaysia (MY)

Malaysian addresses forms are very simple, typically with address lines 1, 2 and
sometimes "additional address information". TBH most websites tested looked like
international websites and those that looked more local could not be tested
because they required a local phone number.

Mexico often asks for street name, house number and apartment number in three
different fields, but it is also frequent that street name and house number are
combined in a single field. Overflow fields, Referencia (navigational
information like the location between to crossing streets or a corner, exist as
well).

costco.com.mx, elpalaciodehierro.com - most websites just ask for both last

[↩](#mx-1)

address-level 1 through 4 are all commonly requested. It is very common to ask
for a house number and an apartment number.

[This
page](https://www.spanish.academy/blog/how-to-write-your-address-in-spanish/)
has more good explanations. E.g. "Entre calles means between streets and it is
used when the place in question is in the middle of the block. When the location
is in a corner you can say esquina con (corner with) and the name of the other
street."

## Nigeria (NG)

Very frequently we see two fields "Address" followed by "Apartment, suite, etc.
(optional)" which seem to be meant as address line 1 and 2. Overall the existing
autocomplete model seems to be sufficient.

## Spain (ES)

Spanish addresses ask for street name and house number in either one or two
input fields. Spain is special because some websites ask for ultra-detailed
information (one field for each of):
- Type of building
- Stair case
- Apartment
- Gate
- Residential area
This information can also be requested in a single address overflow field.

Pretty often a street address field was "powered by Google".

## Turkey (TR)

Turkish addresses are first special because the concept translated to a city
(Şehir/Il) is more comparable to states in other countries.

Turkey had cases where a building identifier (building/apt/block), a floor
number and an apartment numbere were to be filled into three different fields.

# Observations

## Street name + House number

It is very common that websites ask for the street name and house number in
a single field or in a sequence of two fields. Neither case is currently
supported by the autocomplete attribute:

An "address line 1" is not equivalent to "street name + house number". It is
perfectly valid that an "address line 1" contains a company name while the
"address line 2" contains a street name and housenumber.

## Different concepts of "street address"

The spec describes the "street-address" as a sequence of "address-line1" through
"address-line3". If the user is asked to enter a "street-address", websites
often ask for the parts of an address that you would find on Google Maps, Open
Street Map, etc. (i.e. the address of the building, not containing the apartment
information).

## Missing field types

Websites ask for a lot of specific field types to be filled which are not
covered by the autocomplete specification, such as:

* Name (this needs more research and has not been focus of this analysis)
  * First and second last name (hispanic/latinx countries)
  * Patronymic name (slavic countries)
  * Phonetic name (Japan) ([issue](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5821))
  * Prefix, Suffix
  * Gender (male, female, ...)
  * Social title (Mr., Mrs., Mx., ...)
  * Noble title
  * Academic title
* Address
  * Street location (street + house number) `street-location` (abbreviation for
    `[street-name house-number]`)
    * Street name `street-name`
    * House number `house-number`
  * Building `premise`
    * Building name/House
    * Block/Block Number/Residence/Colony (unclear whether this is synonymous to
      the previous entry)
    * Complex
    * Tower No.
  * Location within building `sub-premise` (abbreviation for `[apartment floor
    staircase escalator entrance]`)
    * Apartment number/Flat/Suite *(probably synonymous and should be asstracted
      into one concept)* `apartment`
    * Floor number/Level `floor`
    * Staircase `staircase`
    * Escalator `escalator`
    * Entrance/Gate `entrance`
  * Premise and subpremise `premise-and-sub-premise` (abbreviation for `[premise
    sub-premise]`)
    * Combination of `premise` and `sub-premise`
  * Locating the building
    * Reference (e.g. between two streets)
    * Landmark (sometimes we have a street-address in one field and a landmark in a separate field) `landmark`
  * The address-levelX fields seem to do a reasonable job in most countries, but
    we should probably assume that even tiny countries w/o states store the city
    in address-level2 rather than address-level1. Otherwise it is impossibe to
    fill such an address in an international form.
  * Other
    * Delivery instructions `delivery-instructions`
    * Additional information `address-overflow`
    * what3words address
    * Door code `door-code`
    * Area Details ???
    * Name on the intercom
    * c/o name

## Missing structural support

### Combinations of fields

We frequently see fields that ask for a multiple field types. Frequent examples
contain

* Street name + house number (not to be confused with address-line1)
* Street name + house number + apt number
  * In countries that expect these three pieces of information we see different
    splits:
    * Street name | house number | apt number
    * Street name + house number | apt number
    * Street name + house number + apt number
* Flat, suite, building, floor, etc. (this exists in various versions)
* House/Flat no/Building/Apartment

### Overflow support

It is common that address forms provide an overflow field (e.g. "additional
address information") for everything that is not expressed as a dedicated field.

If the user agent has a user's address, we should probably assume that all
pieces of this address are relevant and should be shared with websites.

## Combining arbitrary fields

The proposal above is based roughly on a hierarchical address model with some
exceptions that break the hierarchy, e.g. `premise-and-sub-premise` pairs two
siblings.

A big question is whether we should allow combining arbitrary fields. For a
field "Apt. Suite, Building or Comany Name", it would be nice to have a
combination like `[sub-premise premise organization]` to express that all of
this information can go into the field. We see several other use cases in
practice: E.g. in Australia we saw a single field asking for a state, city and
zip code. In Indonesia we saw a single field asking for a subdistrict and
district going into a single field. In Poland we saw sites asking for
street-name, house number and apartment number going into a single field.

### Concerns

If we follow this approach, what does that mean for the many details that can
describe an apartment for example? E.g. in Spain, websites often ask for an
apartment number and staircase. Would we expect a Mexican website that typically
only asks for the apartment number to also specify the staircase so that a
Spanish address can be fully expresed?

Maybe we can ignore such concerns because 1) We will never find solutions that
address all edge cases, 2) Domestic orders are more common than international
orders.

### Syntax

I am not convinced that combining multiple field types obliviates the need for
some aggregate fields. We could express `street-location` as `[street-name
house-number]` but how far do we go? Do we also want to enumerate all possible
fields in a `sub-premise`?

There are a number of questions:

1. Do we want the order of fields to matter. Should be browser figure out how to
   combine multiple field types or should it at least try to follow an order.
2. Do we want to support formatting instructions. The simplest instruction could
   describe whether multiple fields are separated by commas, newlines,
   whitespaces. We could allow specifying whether a sertain field is expressed
   with a prefix or suffix. E.g. an apartment number "103" could become "Apt.
   103" either by the website expressing "Apt. " as a prefix, or by the user
   agent knowing "Apt. " as a valid prefix. It maybe desirable to combine fields
   like house number 42 and apartment number 103 into a single term 42-103.

Here is a wild syntax example to express the address
```
c/ P. Díaz #58, Edif. Sur 6to P., depto. 6B,Col. Hac. de Morales, entre c/ Ins. y Av. Univ., Mun. M. Hidalgo, Mér. Yuc., C.P. 02180
```
from https://www.spanish.academy/blog/how-to-write-your-address-in-spanish/.

Let's briefly split this into pieces:

* c/ P. Díaz #58 = Calle (street) P. Díaz, #58 (house number).
* Edif. Sur = edificio (building) Sur
* 6to P. = 6th floor (piso)
* Col. Hac. de Morales (Colonia Hacienda de Morales) (address-level4)
* entre c/ Ins. y Av. Univ. = entrance between streets Ins. and Av. Univ.
* Mun. M. Hidalgo = Municipio M. Hiago (address-level3)
* Mér. Yuc. = Mérida, Yucatán (address-level2, address-level1)
* C.P. 02180 = Código Postal 02180 (postal-code)

This could be expressed as
```
  [prefix: 'c/ '] street-name
  [separator: ' '] [prefix: '#'] house-number
  [separator: ', '] [prefix: 'Edif. '] premise
  [separator: ' '] floor [suffix: O='P.']
  [separator: ', '] [prefix: 'Col. '] address-level4
  [separator: ', '] [prefix: 'entre'] entrance
  # note: we don't know whether the user lives in a Municipio or Delegación
  [separator: ', '] [prefix: 'Del./Mun. '] address-level3
  [separator: ', '] address-level2
  [separator: ' '] address-level1
  [separator: ', '] [prefix: 'C.P. '] postal-code
```

In this example a separator, prefix/suffix would only be printed if the
following/preceding field are non-empty.

This example highlights a shortcoming: Are the prefixes and suffixes part of the
fields or not? A Mexican address-level3 is either a Municipio or Delegación.
Mexico city is divided into Delegacións and other cities are divided into
Municipio. If the user enters their address-level3 into a form, they would
probably not enter "Municipio" or "Delegación" into the field. But if we want
to take an address and serialize it into a single field, it would be nice if
we knew. Maybe a package would also be delivered without this information.

The situation in Indonesia is similar:

If the address is in a city:
```
Jalan [Street Name] No. [Unit Number]
Kelurahan [Subdistrict], Kecamatan [District]
[City], [Province], [Postal code]
Indonesia
```

If the address is in a regency:
```
Jalan [Street Name] No. [Unit Number]
Kelurahan [Subdistrict], Kecamatan [District]
Kabupaten [Regency], [Province], [Postal code]
Indonesia
```

The challenge that the address-level2 is a city or a regency. In the latter case
the name of the regency should be prefixed by "Kabupaten". However in a
structured address that asks for "Kota/Kabupaten" (city/regency), one would
probably not repeat Kabupaten. So the value of the address-level2 field would
only be "[City]" or "[Regency]".
